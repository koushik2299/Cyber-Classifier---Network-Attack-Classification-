# Network Attack Classification Project Report

## Executive Summary
This project aimed to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying different types of network attacks using the UNSW-NB15 dataset. Through careful data analysis, feature selection, and model training, we engineered an ensemble model achieving 95% accuracy. This report outlines the methodologies employed, key findings, and insights gained from collaborating with industry professionals.

## Introduction
With cyber-attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated, the need for advanced detection systems is more critical than ever. This project leverages the UNSW-NB15 dataset, containing over 2 million records, to train a model that accurately classifies network traffic into various attack types or normal activity.

## Methodology

### Data Analysis and Feature Selection
- **Dataset:** The UNSW-NB15 dataset, comprising over 2 million records, was chosen for its comprehensive range of attack simulations.
- **Feature Selection:** Employing statistical tests such as T-Test and Chi-square, we identified 15 out of 45 features that significantly impact model accuracy.
- **Tools Used:** Python for data manipulation, Snowflake for ad-hoc analysis, and statistical software for hypothesis testing.

### Model Development
- **Ensemble Modeling:** An ensemble model was engineered for its superior ability to improve prediction accuracy and mitigate overfitting.
- **Training and Testing:** The dataset was split into an 80% training set and a 20% testing set, ensuring an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance.

### Collaboration and Domain Knowledge
- **Industry Collaboration:** Consultations with industry professionals were integral in ensuring the model's applicability to real-world scenarios.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Insights and methodologies were shared with academic and industry experts, fostering a collaborative environment.

## Results
- **Model Performance:** The final ensemble model demonstrated a remarkable 95% accuracy in classifying network attacks.
- **Feature Efficacy:** The reduced feature set not only streamlined the model but also retained high predictive power.
- **Industry Relevance:** Feedback from industry professionals confirmed the model's relevance and potential for real-world application.

## Discussion
